# IndianRest_Project

In this project, I completed an exploratory analysis on the datasets 'indian-takeaway-orders' using pyspark.

I aimed to answer the 3 following questions:

- Which item is the most ordered off the menu in both restaurants?
- Which dates had the most orders in both restaurant?
- Which restuarant (rest_1/order_1 or rest_2/order_2) shown to have more success?
